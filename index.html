<p class="custom">isGrafLab (Irregular Surface GRAvity Field LABoratory) is 
a modified version of GrafLab that allows accurate and fast computation of 
functionals of the geopotential at dense grids residing on irregular surfaces 
such as the Earth's surface. It employs the efficient lumped coefficients 
approach for surface spherical harmonic synthesis of the functionals and their 
radial derivatives at regular surfaces (sphere or ellipsoid of revolution), and 
the Taylor series expansions to continue the functionals to the irregular 
surface.</p>

<!-- GOCE models -->
<h2 class="custom" id="GOCE-only_gravity_models">GOCE-only global gravity field 
models from the kinematic orbit</h2>

<p class="custom">The GOCE-only global spherical harmonic gravity field models models developed by <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-015-9344-0" target="_blank">Bucha et al. (2015)</a> can be downloaded <a href="goce_gravity_models/STU_GOCE_R1.zip" target="_blank">here</a> (~1.8 MB).
</p>

<p class="custom">The models were estimated from the kinematic orbit of the 
GOCE satellite (time period from 01 November 2009 to 11 January 2010 which is 
equal to the R1 period used by the official ESA's models).  Further details:
<ul>
  <li class="custom">the models were originally derived by means of spherical 
  radial basis functions (Shannon SRBF) and were transformed into spherical 
  harmonics after the evaluation; the transformation is exact without any 
  approximations,</li>

  <li class="custom">the <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2013.11.031" 
  target="_blank">acceleration approach</a> was used to invert the kinematic 
  orbit into gravity field models,</li>

  <li class="custom">the problematic near-zonal coefficients (polar gap) are 
  stabilized by prior information obtained from our own low-degree GOCE-only 
  models, so that the final models are still GOCE-only,</li>

  <li class="custom">the models are estimated up to relatively high harmonic 
  degrees (75, 100, 130) to mitigate the aliasing, but it is not recommended to 
  use them beyond degree, say, 70 due to the adverse signal-to-noise 
  ratio,</li>

  <li class="custom">the models are provided in the <a 
href="http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/ICGEM-Format-2011.pdf" 
target="_blank">gfc</a> format as defined by <a 
      href="http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de" target="_blank">ICGEM</a> 
      (International Centre for Global Earth Models).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="custom">The effect caused by the stabilization of the near-zonal 
coefficients is shown in the figure below (Bucha et al., 2015).</p>

<!-- Moon models -->
<h2 class="custom" id="Moon_gravity_models">Divergence-free spherical harmonic 
gravity models of the Moon's topographic masses</h2>

<p class="custom">These models approximate the gravitational field induced by topographic masses of the Moon and mitigate <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JE005298" target="_blank">the divergence effect of spherical harmonics in the vicinity of the Moon's topography</a>. The models rely on the Runge&#8212Krarup theorem and enable generally a more accurate evaluation of gravity field quantities close to the lunar topography as compared to the models from spectral gravity forward modelling. This is because the latter ones may suffer from the divergence effect when evaluating the spherical harmonic series on or below the limit sphere encompassing all the gravitating masses (that is, also on the topography). In the figure below, the two approaches are validated with respect to a third (reference) one (Bucha et al., 2019). The upper map shows the reference signal, the middle one depicts the differences related to the Runge&#8212Krarup solution and the bottom one validates the spectral gravity forward modelling technique; note the different colour bars.</p>
<center><figure><img src="img/idc/sgfm-idc.png" width="473" 
height="916"/></figure></center>

<p class="custom">We provide 12 models that approximate the gravity field 
implied by the lunar topographic masses. The topographic masses are expanded up 
to degrees 90, 180, 360 and 720, and the maximum degree of the gravity field 
models varies from 360 up to 2160. All models (~320 MB) are available for

<a href="http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/tom_celestial" target="_blank">ICGEM</a>, 
where it can be find under a shortened name "STU_MoonTopo720".</p>

<p class="custom">The corresponding models that may suffer from the divergence effect were derived by <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JE005298" target="_blank">Hirt and Kuhn (2017)</a> and can be downloaded <a href="http://ddfe.curtin.edu.au/gravitymodels/2017Archive_GFM_Moon/" target="_blank">here</a>, including grids of reference gravity disturbances from spatial-domain Newtonian integration.</p>

target="_blank">Cap-modified spectral gravity forward modelling</a> is 
a spectral technique to deliver near- and/or far-zone gravity effects implied 
by topographic masses, the shape of which is given as a surface spherical 
harmonic series. From the numerical point of view, one of its most difficult 
parts is the accurate computation of the associated Molodensky's truncation 
coefficients. This is because this evaluation may necessitate to extend the 
number of significant digits from 16 (double precision) to, say, 64 or even 
256. Here, this was achieved using the MATLAB's <a

<p class="custom">MATLAB-based routines to compute the truncation coefficients and their radial and horizontal derivatives (require the ADVANPIX toolbox) can be downloaded <a href="truncation_coefficients_code/Qnpkj_code.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.

The coefficients are evaluated for
<ul>
<li class="custom">the spherical distance of $\psi_0 = 100000\ \mathrm{m}\ /\ 6378137\ \mathrm{m}$ (100 km integration radius from the evaluation point),</li>

<p class="text_highlight"><b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
--------<br>
Name: SRBF_package<br>
Description: Routines for gravity field modelling with spherical radial basis 
functions<br>
Programming Languages: Fortran (+ Python wrapper), MATLAB<br>
Version: 1.0 for Fortran, 1.1 for MATLAB<br>
Updated: Feb 26, 2020 for Fortran; Feb 18, 2020 for MATLAB<br>
Download: <a href="srbf_package/SRBF_package.zip" target="_blank">SRBF_package.zip</a></p>

<p class="custom">SRBF_package is a collection of a few routines for gravity field modelling with band-limited spherical radial basis functions (SRBFs), allowing both analysis and synthesis of the gravitational field. Harmonically analysed can be the gravitational potential (or any other continuous scalar function on a 2D sphere), while synthesis is possible for the gravitational potential, the gravitational vector in LNOF and the gravitational tensor in LNOF. To our knowledge, the equations to synthesize the gravitational tensor are novel and are more efficient than other formulae (e.g., that from Appendix of Bucha et al., 2016). This is because only three radial basis functions are needed to compute six unique elements of the gravitational tensor. This may improve the computational speed, as the evaluation of band-limited spherical radial basis functions (the sum over harmonic degrees) is the most time-consuming part of the synthesis.</p>

<p class="custom">As an example of a band-limited SRBF, the figure below depicts the smoothed Shannon SRBF.</p>

<center><figure><img src="img/srbf-package/smoothed-shannon.png" width="630" height="420"/></figure></center>

<p class="custom">The package is an enhanced version of the MATLAB-based routines used by Bucha et al. (2016). It is available as MATLAB-based functions and Fortran 95 routines accompanied by a Python wrapper. The MATLAB synthesis is parallelized using "parfor" and the Fortran synthesis and analysis are parallelized using OpenMP (the "!$OMP PARALLEL DO" directive). When using the same number of CPUs, the Fortran routines can be up to about 10 times faster than their MATLAB-counterparts. The Python wrapper allows an easy access to the Fortran routines for Python users.</p>

<p class="custom">Attached to the package are also also test data, manuals with a detailed description of the package and scripts with two test computations to verify the correctness of the implementation in MATLAB, Fortran and Python. While the test examples are based on global gravity field modelling for clarity, SRBF_package was developed primarily for regional applications with a residual gravity field. This is because SRBF_package is significantly slower when compared to FFT-based SHS and SHA, both of which are designed for global applications. Although the package was designed mainly for gravity field modelling, other applications are possible. Further details can be found in the attached PDF.</p>

<p class="custom">GMSQ2019 is a Gravimetric Model of the Slovak Quasigeoid at 2 arc-sec spatial resolution. It is developed from a high-resolution regional gravity field model (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw311" target="_blank">Bucha et al. 2016</a>), which relies on gravity information from (i) EIGEN-6C4 up to degree 2190 (~9 km resolution), (ii) dense terrestrial gravity data modelled by spherical radial basis functions up to degree 21600 (~30 arc-sec), and (iii) residual terrain modelling (~2 arc-sec).</p>

 <p class="custom">A validation of GMSQ2019 based on 34 high-quality GNSS/levelling data revealed a standard deviation of 1.9 cm. When including reference data of worse quality (but higher quantity, in total 8838), the standard deviation reaches 4.3 cm and a systematic bias of -0.5 m is observed.</p>

 <p class="custom">The development of GMSQ2019 is discussed in detail in a technical report (in Slovak), which is freely available at <a href="https://www.geoportal.sk/files/gz/bucha-et-al-2019-gmsq2019-technicka-sprava.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.geoportal.sk/files/gz/bucha-et-al-2019-gmsq2019-technicka-sprava.pdf</a> (~17 MB).

<p class="custom">grav-sr-2arcsec is a suite of 2-arcsec surface gravitational maps of the Slovak Republic in terms of
<ul>
<li class="custom">the gravitational potential ($V$),</li>
<li class="custom">the full gravitational vector ($V_x$, $V_y$, $V_z$) in the local north-oriented reference frame (LNOF), and</li>
<li class="custom">the full gravitational tensor in LNOF ($V_{xx}$, $V_{xy}$, $\dots$, $V_{zz}$).</li>  
</ul>
</p>

<p class="custom">Below is shown the $V_{zz}$ element of the gravitational tensor over the High and Low Tatra Mountains, representing the roughest part of Slovakia.</p>

<center><figure><img src="img/grav-sr-2arcsec/vy-high-and-low-tatras.png" 
width="630" height="420"/></figure></center>

<p class="custom">High-resolution figures of the entire grids can be found for all ten quantities in the "figs" directory at link above (more than 30 MB per figure).</p>

<p class="custom">The suite was computed from a high-resolution gravity field model of Slovakia developed by <a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw311" target="_blank">Bucha et al. (2016)</a>. The maps rely on three sources of gravitational information:
<ul>
<li class="custom">the Zero-Tide version of the global geopotential model EIGEN-6C4 (Forste, C. et al., 2014) up to degree 2190 (~5 arcmin resolution, ~9 km),</li>
<li class="custom">the expansion of the residual gravitational signal up to degree 21600 in terms of spherical radial basis functions (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw311" target="_blank">Bucha et al. 2016</a>) (~30 arcsec, ~950 m), and</li>
<li class="custom">residual terrain modelling (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw311" target="_blank">Bucha et al. 2016</a>) (2 arcsec, ~60 m).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="custom">An independent validation of grav-sr-2arcsec revealed the 
standard deviation of 0.789 mGal in terms of the gravity.</p>

<p class="custom">Since the residual terrain modelling technique is based on the constant-mass density assumption, grav-sr-2arcsec must *not* be geophysically interpreted at resolutions higher than ~30 arcsec (~950 m).  This is because this information comes solely from the shape of the topography and a constant mass density, so the effect of anomalous densities is *not* captured beyond the ~30 arcsec resolution.  In the case of the combination "EIGEN-6C4" + "residual terrain modelling" (that is, no spherical radial basis functions), the geophysically relevant information can be found only up to the resolution of EIGEN-6C4, that is, ~9 km.  Nevertheless, the residual terrain modelling grids are still very useful for improving the accuracy with respect to independent ground-truth (e.g., observed terrestrial gravity).</p>

<p class="custom">Unfortunately, due to the license restrictions, the gravitational information captured by spherical radial basis functions is not allowed to be published as user-friendly grids.  The information is, however, provided in terms of expansion coefficients of spherical radial basis functions, so that one can *exactly* reproduce their contribution, avoiding any approximations (attached is an efficient ready-to-use Fortran program that will do the work for you).</p>

<p class="custom">To name a few possible applications:
<ul>
<li class="custom">screening observed terrestrial gravity for possible outliers,

<li class="custom">reduction of observed terrestrial gravity from the sensor height down to the ground level,

<li class="custom">computation of gravity anomalies/disturbances, deflections of the vertical, disturbing tensor, etc.,

<li class="custom">geoid/quasigeoid determination,

<li class="custom">accurate reduction of observed horizontal angles to a cartographic projection using deflections of the vertical,

<li class="custom">investigations of the curvature of plumb lines,

<li class="custom">geophysical interpretations,

<li class="custom">educational purposes &#8212 from elementary schools (Kids, 
what is the gravitational field, anyway?  Do you know how the gravitational 
field looks like?  By investigating the maps, can you say whether the 
gravitational field is strong or weak in your town/village?  In which place in 
Slovakia does the gravitational field pull you downward the most? Etcetera, 
etcetera, etcetera) to universities,

<p class="custom">
The GFM_DE_rule package computes the gravitational potential of a body, the 
shape of which is given by a surface spherical harmonic expansion and the 
density of which is constant. The evaluation points can be located inside the 
body, on its surface or outside the body.
</p>

<p class="custom">
The package builds on the spatial-domain gravity forward modelling technique developed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aa88b8" target="_blank">Fukushima (2017)</a>. It evaluates the Newton integral in the spatial domain via the double exponential rule. The Fortran routines from that paper are utilized, while several modifications were necessary to fit the goals of the package.
</p>

<p class="custom">
The package is written in Fortran and MATLAB. The Fortran version supports computations in double as well as quadruple precision and is generally faster than the MATLAB version.
</p>

<p class="custom">
The accuracy of the output potential can reach 14 correct digits in double precision and ~30 digits in quadruple precision. The accuracy level is controlled via a relative tolerance error parameter. The higher the required accuracy, the longer the computation times can be expected. The package was designed mainly for modelling gravitational fields of bodies with shapes expanded to low-degree surface spherical harmonic series.
</p>

<p class="custom">
As an example, below are shown respectively degree-15 surface spherical 
harmonic expansion of shape of the asteroid Bennu (units are metres) and the 
implied surface gravitational potential ($\mathrm{m}^2 \, \mathrm{s}^{-2}$). At 
99.4 % of the grid points, the gravitational potential is computed correctly up 
to the 14th digit. The figures are due to <a

Description: Dataset from the <a

</p>

<p class="custom">
In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-021-01493-w" target="_blank">Bucha 
and Sanso (2021)</a>, we investigated three spherical-harmonic-based techniques 
to deliver external gravitational field models of the asteroid (101955) Bennu 
within its circumscribing sphere. This region is known to be peculiar for 
external spherical harmonic expansions, because it may lead to a divergent 
series. The studied approaches are

<ul>
<li class="custom">spectral gravity forward modelling via external spherical harmonics,</li>
<li class="custom">the least-squares estimation from surface gravitational data using external spherical harmonics, and</li>
<li class="custom">the combination of internal and external series expansions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="custom">
While the first method diverges beyond any reasonable doubts, we show that the 
other two methods may ensure relative accuracy from ${\sim}10^{-6}$ to 
$10^{-8}$ in the vicinity of Bennu. This is possible even with the second 
method, despite the fact that it relies on a single series of external 
spherical harmonics. Our main motivation was to study conceptual differences 
between spherical harmonic coefficients from satellite data (analogy to the 
first method) and from surface gravitational data (the second method). Such 
coefficients are available through the popular spherical-harmonic-based models 
of the Earth's gravitational field and often are combined together. We show 
that the coefficients from terrestrial data may lead to a divergence effect of 
partial sums, though excellent accuracy can be achieved when such model is used 
in full. Under (presently) extreme but realistic conditions, the divergence 
effect of partial sums may affect many near-surface geoscientific applications, 
such as the geoid/quasigeoid computation or residual terrain modelling.

<p class="custom">
The dataset is available at the link above.  Next follows a brief 
description.</p>

<br>
<p class="custom"><b>Surface spherical harmonic coefficients of Bennu's shape</b></p>

<p class="custom">The shape surface spherical harmonic coefficients of Bennu 
are provided up to maximum harmonic degree 15 and were computed from a <a 
   href="https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/bennushape.html" 
   target="_blank">polyhedral shape model</a>. The physical model of Bennu was 
   obtained after assigning a single-constant mass density of $\rho = 1260\ 
   \mathrm{kg} \, \mathrm{m}^{-3}$ to this shape. A figure of the synthesized 
   shape of Bennu is provided in the <a href="#GFM_DE_rule">GFM_DE_rule</a> 
   section above. The original polyhedral model is shown below (colour bar in 
   meters, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-021-01493-w"

<br>
<p class="custom"><b>Spectral gravity forward modelling using external spherical harmonics</b></p>
<p class="custom">Using the degree-15 shape expansion of Bennu and assuming 
a constant-mass density, we computed spherical harmonic coefficients of the 
external gravitational potential using spectral gravity forward modelling. The 
maximum degree of the potential coefficients is 225. On a Brillouin sphere, 
they reproduce the gravitational potential with a 14-digit accuracy or 
better. However, on/below the sphere of convergence, including the surface of 
Bennu, the spherical harmonic series diverges and produces grossly invalid 
results. The figure below shows the standard deviations of the errors of the 
model as a function of maximum harmonic degree (<a 
   href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-021-01493-w" target="_blank">Bucha and 
   Sanso, 2021</a>).</p>

<center><figure><img src="img/bennu/bennu-sgfm-validation.png" width="630" 
height="420"/></figure></center>

<br>
<p class="custom"><b>Least-squares estimation from surface gravitational data using external spherical harmonics</b></p>
<p class="custom">To allow for an accurate spherical-harmonic-based 
gravitational field modelling everywhere on and above the surface of Bennu 
while still relying on external spherical harmonics, we developed models from 
surface gravitational data using the least-squares estimation. These models 
rely on the Runge&#8212Krarup theorem and provide an $\varepsilon$-accuracy, 
$\varepsilon > 0$, everywhere on and above Bennu. In our case, they outperform 
    spectral gravity forward modelling on the surface of Bennu by more than 
    3 orders of magnitude (relative accuracy is ${\sim}10^{-6}$; <a 
   href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-021-01493-w" target="_blank">Bucha and 
   Sanso, 2021</a>). The models were estimated up to maximum degrees 0, 5, 10, 
   ..., 65.  The figure below validates them on the surface of Bennu; the solid 
   colour lines represent standard deviations of the errors of the 
   least-squares models and the dashed black line represents spectral gravity 
   forward modelling.</p>

<center><figure><img src="img/bennu/bennu-ls-validation.png" width="630" 
height="420"/></figure></center>

<p class="custom">The computation of the models took 90 CPU years.</p>

<br>
<p class="custom"><b>Combination of internal and external series expansions</b></p>
<p class="custom">Finally, spherical harmonic coefficients of the internal and 
external series expansions were computed. They do not suffer from the 
divergence, but their usage on the surface of Bennu is less straightforward as 
with external spherical harmonics. The figure below (<a 
   href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-021-01493-w" target="_blank">Bucha and 
   Sanso, 2021</a>) shows the accuracy levels achieved with spectral gravity 
   forward modelling (the orange curve), least-squares method (green) and the 
   combination of internal and external series expansions (blue) as a function 
   of harmonic degree.

<p class="custom">Reference gravitational data (accurate up to the 14th digit) 
on a Brillouin sphere, a mean sphere and the surface of Bennu are also

<h2 class="custom" id="teaching-with-open-source">A non-scientific rambling 
  &#8212 Online teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic with open source 
  software</h2>

<p class="custom">As a university lecturer, I lead seminars on Physical 
Geodesy.  For the last couple of months, I have been forced, similarly as many 
other teachers, to move my seminars online.  Here, I would like to share my 
one-year experience with online teaching and to show what has worked for me the 
best, hoping there is perhaps someone, who might benefit from this.</p>

<p class="custom">When it comes to online teaching at a public university, the 
following issues are important for me as a teacher.

<br>

<li class="custom">I want to ensure that students do not need to install any 
additional software to be able to participate on the seminars.</li>

<br>

<li class="custom">I want to ensure that students do not need create any kind 
of account at various online services.</li>

<br>

<li class="custom">I want to use only open source software.</li>

<br>

<li class="custom">I want to use only software that is secure, e.g. employs 
end-to-end encryption.</li>
</p>

<p class="custom">My seminars are given synchronously, that is, me and my 
students meet together in real time.  An inevitable part of teaching is a 
discussion.  To allow for this, I am using <a 
href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a>, which is a 
secure, free video conferencing tool.  While Jitsi Meet allows everyone to 
freely and easily create a <a href="https://meet.jit.si/" target="_blank">video 
conference</a>, it is more flexible for me to rely on my own server with the 
Jitsi Meet tool running on it.  This overcomes some of the difficulties that 
may be associated with third party servers, such as slow internet connection 
when the traffic on the public servers is high (this may happen, for instance, 
during a lockdown).  After thinking a while, I found many other essential 
reasons for not using public servers.  So, for about 15 EUR per year, I bought 
a domain <a href="https://www.blazejbucha.com" 
target="_blank">https://www.blazejbucha.com</a>, redirected it to my work PC 
running on <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian</a> and 
installed Jitsi Meet on it (with a help of my kind colleague).  Now, whenever I 
need to give a seminar, to have a discussion on a student's work or thesis, or 
just to meet a student, I simply start the Jitsi Meet server, find some cool 
name for our meeting, protect the meeting by a password and then we can enjoy 
all the fascinating issues of Physical Geodesy!  All the student needs is a web 
browser.  It's secure, it's comfortable and it's fun.  In case you are 
satisfied with public servers, <a href="https://meet.jit.si/" 
target="_blank">this</a> works well, too (tested).</p>

<p class="custom">Physical Geodesy is full of nice and cool equations which is 
exactly why my students love studying it.  But for real-time online teaching, 
this posses some difficulties, major or minor, depending on the equipment you 
have at your disposal (e.g., some board, tablet or so).  As I don't like buying 
new stuff and I need to be flexible (one day I may work from my home, the other 
day from my office), I have opted for a minimalistic yet powerful (I think) 
approach.  I decided I'll be writing all the nice equations we need to discuss 
on a paper; at the same time, using a camera on my smartphone, I will be 
displaying all the stuff I am doing on the paper on the display of my smart 
phone; finally, the display of my smart phone will be mirrored to my PC using 
an USB cable.  This may sound too complicated, but the exact opposite is true 
in fact!  As a result, I have a window open on my PC that shows all the magical 
stuff that is happening on the paper, which is then shared via the Jitsi Meet's 
screen sharing to students. The students are then able to see (in real time) 
all the equations, listen to my comments, ask questions, etc.  For me, this is 
much better than having some presentation slides prepared beforehand, because I 
can now interact with the students, draw some additional sketches based on 
their questions and so on, similarly as we did back in the times, when we could 
meet in person.  On my smartphone, I am using the <a 
href="https://lineageos.org/" target="_blank">LineageOS</a> operating system 
(not needed though, Android will work fine, too).  To mirror my phone's 
display, I am using a lightweight application called <a 
href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy" target="_blank">scrcpy</a>.  The 
application is simple and works great for all my needs.  Whenever needed, I 
have the stream of the phone's camera displayed on the full screen on the PC's 
monitor.  To ensure smooth and well visible streaming of my handwriting, I put 
the phone horizontally on an elevated firm support, making sure there is no 
visual barrier between the paper and the phone's camera.</p>

<p class="custom">For me, this approach works quite well.  I do not need any 
special equipment, I can easily work both from my home or from my office, all 
the software is free and open source, students do not need to install any 
additional software and we can smoothly communicate together.  In fact, I am 
quite enjoying it!  Should any of this help you, I will be happy if you give me 
some feedback or perhaps let me know of your own favourite features.</p>
